## Change Request
If you found that the existing guide need any changes due to outdated
information, confusion, or area of improvements, please open a new issue with
Change label.

Please try to search the Github Issue Tracker for existing issues. Please be as
details as possible on the change you want.

It would also be great if a change issue can comes with a pull request :)

## New Guide
Please open an issue labeled with Guide.

Each guide's content can have some overlap but for adding a new guide to Skygear
Doc there should be a strong reason why the existing guide can't cover the
topics already. It would be great if the issue can be specific about what the
guide shall cover. A simple ToC could be included in an issue like that.
