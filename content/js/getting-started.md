## Signing up at Portal

To start using the Skygear JS SDK, you need to register your account and
application at the [Skygear Developer Portal](https://portal.skygear.io/signup).
You will be able to monitor your Skygear server and acquire information, such
as your `Server EndPoint` and `API Key`, on the portal page.

## About the SDK

Skygear provides a complete and open-source backend solution for your
web applications. Our aim is to free front end developers from worrying about
writing backend code or maintaining database.

The SDK fully abstracts the way you interact with server so that you no longer
need to deal with complicated AJAX requests or socket connections. The SDK
talks to your Skygear server directly. With simple API calls and elegant
Promise syntax, you can achieve almost anything in your web app:
- Signing up a new user
- Logging in an existing user
- Saving and retrieving data
- Querying data with complicated conditions
- Setting access control for different users
- Managing relationship between users
- Sending and receiving instant message/data via Publish-Subscribe service
- Working with geolocation data
- Uploading images and files

The SDK is written in [Babel 6 ES 2015](https://babeljs.io/), available on
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skygear), and open-source on
[GitHub](https://github.com/SkygearIO/skygear-SDK-JS). Let us know your issues
or comments, and public contributions are welcomed.
