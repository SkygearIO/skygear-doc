## Signing up at Portal

Before setting up the Skygear JS SDK, you need to have the Skygear server ready.
You can sign up for one at the [Skygear Developer Portal](https://portal.skygear.io/signup).
In the portal, You will also be able to monitor your Skygear server and acquire
information, such as your server endpoint and API key.

## About the SDK

The SDK fully abstracts the way you interact with server so that you no longer
need to deal with complicated AJAX requests or socket connections. The SDK
talks to your Skygear server directly. With simple API calls and elegant
Promise syntax, you can easily achieve many things in your web app:
- Signing up and logging in users
- Saving and retrieving data
- Querying data with complex conditions
- Setting access control for different users and roles
- Managing follower/following/friend relationship between users
- Sending and receiving instant message/data via Publish-Subscribe service
- Working with geolocation data
- Uploading images and files

The SDK is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skygear) and
open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/SkygearIO/skygear-SDK-JS). Let us
know your issues or comments, and public contributions are welcomed.
