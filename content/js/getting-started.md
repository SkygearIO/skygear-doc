## Signing up at Portal

Before [installing the Skygear JS SDK](/js/guide/install-sdk), you need to have
a Skygear server ready. If you haven't got one already, you can sign up for a managed hosting at the
[Skygear Portal](https://portal.skygear.io/signup).
The deployment of the server is handled automatically at the managed hosting
so you can start installing and using the JS SDK right away.

## About the SDK

The JS SDK lets you integrate your web app or
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app with Skygear
quickly. Based on the asynchronous Promise pattern, the SDK communicates with
the Skygear server, and allows you to perform a variety of tasks easily:

- Authenticating users
- Saving/Querying records to/from the database with various data types
- Setting access control for different users and roles in accessing
  database records
- Managing follower/following/friend relationship between users
- Sending and receiving instant message via Publish-Subscribe (PubSub)
- Uploading images and files

The SDK is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skygear) and is
open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/SkygearIO/skygear-SDK-JS).
Please feel free to contribute and let us know your issues and comments.
