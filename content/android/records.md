## Overview

Please make sure you know about and have already configured your skygear
[container](/android/guide#setting-up) before you proceed.

### The Record Class

### Record Database

Before any record operations, you need to understand the record databases in
Skygear. You will provide with private and public database:

- Everything in private database is truely private, regardless of what access
control entity you set to the record.
- Record saved at public database is defualt public. To control the access, you
may set difference access control entity to the record.

In the SDK, you can get the public or private database using:

```java
// get Skygear Container
Container skygear = Container.defaultContainer(this);

// get public database
Database publicDatabase = skygear.getPublicDatabase();

// get private database
Database privateDatabase = skygear.getPrivateDatabase();
```

## Basic CRUD

### Create a record

Records in Skygear are specified via __type__ and __id__. You must provide a record
type when you create a record while the record id will be generated when you
create a record.

```java
Record aNote = new Record("Note");
```

You can assign some attributes to the record. All attribute keys should be a
string while attribute values can be in many types. Currently, all primitive
types, array of primitive types and Java `Date` type are supported.

```java
// assign some attributes
aNote.set("title", "Hello World");
aNote.set("readCount", 4);
aNote.set("lastReadAt", new Date());

// get some attributes
String title = (String) aNote.get("title");
int title = (int) aNote.get("readCount");
```

You can save a record to either __public__ or __private__ database:

```java
RecordSaveResponseHandler handler = new RecordSaveResponseHandler(){
    @Override
    public void onSaveSuccess(Record[] records) {
        Log.i(
            "Skygear Record Save",
            "Successfully saved " + records.length + " records"
        );
    }

    @Override
    public void onPartiallySaveSuccess(
        Map<String, Record> successRecords,
        Map<String, String> reasons
    ) {
        Log.i(
            "Skygear Record Save",
            "Successfully saved " + successRecords.size() + " records"
        );
        Log.i(
            "Skygear Record Save",
            reasons.size() + " records are fail to save"
        );
    }

    @Override
    public void onSaveFail(String reason) {
        Log.i(
            "Skygear Record Save",
            "Fail to save: " + reason
        );
    }
};

database.save(aNote, handler);
```

Also, you can save multiple records at one time:

```java
Record[] records = new Record[]{ note1, note2, note3 };
database.save(records, handler);
```

### Reading a record

You can use `Query` object to find records with conditions:

```java
Query query = new Query("Note")
        .greaterThan("readCount", 3)
        .caseInsensitiveLike("title", "%hello%");
```

The following code snippet shows how to perform record query with `Query` object:

```java
RecordQueryResponseHandler handler = new RecordQueryResponseHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onQuerySuccess(Record[] records) {
        Log.i(
            "Skygear Record Query",
            String.format("Successfully got %d records", records.length)
        );
    }

    @Override
    public void onQueryError(String reason) {
        Log.i(
            "Skygear Record Query",
            "Fail to delete: " + reason
        );
    }
}

database.query(query, handler);

```

For more information, please check out the [Query Section](/android/guide/query)

### Updating a record

After saving the records, some meta attributes are available on the records:

```java
// the time when the record created
Date createdAt = aNote.getCreatedAt();

// the time when the record last updated
Date updatedAt = aNote.getUpdatedAt();

// the creator ID, the updater ID and the record owner ID
String creatorId = aNote.getCreatorId();
String updaterId = aNote.getUpdaterId();
String ownerId = aNote.getOwnerId();
```

### Deleting a record

You can delete a record on either __public__ or __private__ database:

```java
RecordDeleteResponseHandler handler = new RecordDeleteResponseHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onDeleteSuccess(String[] ids) {
        Log.i(
            "Skygear Record Delete",
            "Successfully deleted " + ids.length + " records"
        );
    }

    @Override
    public void onDeletePartialSuccess(String[] ids, Map<String, String> reasons) {
        Log.i(
            "Skygear Record Delete",
            "Successfully deleted " + ids.length + " records"
        );
        Log.i(
            "Skygear Record Delete",
            reasons.size() + " records are fail to delete"
        );
    }

    @Override
    public void onDeleteFail(String reason) {
        Log.i(
            "Skygear Record Delete",
            "Fail to delete: " + reason
        );
    }
});

database.delete(aNote, handler);
```

Of cause, you can delete multiple records at one time:

```java
Record[] records = new Record[]{ note1, note2, note3 };
database.delete(records, handler);
```
