## Signing up at Portal

Before [installing the Skygear Android SDK](/android/guide/install-sdk),
you need to have a Skygear server ready. If you haven't got one already,
you can sign up for a managed hosting at the
[Skygear Portal](https://portal.skygear.io/signup).
The deployment of the server is handled automatically at the managed hosting
so you can start installing and using the Android SDK right away.

## About the SDK

The Android SDK allows you to integrate your Android app with Skygear
quickly. The SDK communicates with the Skygear server,
and allows you to perform a variety of tasks easily:

- Authenticating users
- Saving/Querying records to/from the database with various data types
- Setting access control for different users and roles in accessing
  database records
- Managing follower/following/friend relationship between users
- Sending and receiving instant message via Publish-Subscribe (PubSub)
- Sending push notifications
- Uploading images and files

The SDK is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/SkygearIO/skygear-SDK-IOS).
Please feel free to contribute and let us know your issues and comments.
